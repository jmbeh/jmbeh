# Hi, I'm JM 👋

Strategy is intent; code is reality. That's why I code agentically—building tools that solve real problems in my life, and learning from what breaks.

### 🧪 What I'm Building

**[Nutty Baseball](https://github.com/jmbeh/nutty_baseball)** — I'm learning baseball alongside my son. The Peanuts theme wasn't just decoration; it reframed "I don't know baseball" from embarrassing to endearing.  
*Next up: Ambient listening for backyard games—tracking scores from natural conversation.*

**[Dad Aura](https://github.com/jmbeh/dad-aura)** — Real-time aura scoring from my son's Apple Watch. What surprised me: him controlling score "flips" created more engagement than the scoring itself.  
*Next up: AI guardrails that know when to say no and nurture healthy values.*

**[Allegro](https://github.com/jmbeh/Allegro)** — A music practice companion. I learned that audio recognition trained on studio recordings fails completely when kids stop mid-phrase and play wrong notes.  
*Next up: Real-time "play along" suggestions so I can jam with my kids on guitar.*

**[LifeSynced](https://github.com/jmbeh/LifeSynced)** — Unified calendar with a privacy-first design. The "[Personal Event]" placeholder with password reveal made it safe to demo to any audience.  
*Next up: An AI agent that proactively reminds and helps plan the important life events.*

### 🛠️ Stack

Next.js, TypeScript, Python for prototyping. PostgreSQL for data, Vercel for infrastructure. Cursor as my IDE, LangChain and MCP for agent frameworks. The tools matter less than the mindset—I pick what lets me move fast and learn deeply.

### 💼 Day Job

Director at Adobe Commerce. I'm building a prototype library for agentic development, codifying monetization expertise, and evangelizing AI-first PM craft. Work repos are internal, but I'm always happy to discuss patterns and share what I've learned.
